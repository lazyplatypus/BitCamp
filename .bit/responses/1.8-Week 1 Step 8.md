## Two Catz API 

### ✅  Task:
- [ ] Make sure you're in the `week1` branch.
- [ ] Commit the function's code in a file named `CatAPI.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!
- [ ] You should return the images and names in **JSON format** in the body
    ```js
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
    ```
### 🚧 Test your Work
When you paste your **Function URL** in your browser or make a GET request with **Postman**, you might get something like:
```json
{
  "cat1": "/9j/4AAQSk...",
  "cat2": "R0lGODlhCwHI...",
   "names": [
    "Daniel",
    "Shreya"
  ]
```
> :bulb: The Base64 is shortened for clarity!

This is the last step to completing your Cat API app! Use information from the past issues in order to program the solution.

<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
